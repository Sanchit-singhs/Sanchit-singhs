## - ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sanchit-singhs
Hey there,
I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer science engineering and also work as subject matter expert at chegg. By working while being a student gave me an opportunity to gain work experience at some early basis and polished my skills in Java web development and Html.
as all of the work I get from chegg needs to be done in a thorough manner and should be precise to the point that made me an efficient programmer.
Thank you for Visiting my profile.
Have a nice day
